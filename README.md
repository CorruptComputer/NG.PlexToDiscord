# Plex to Discord

Poll Plex for new media 

If found send a message to the Discord channel with a list

Something like should be good I think.
```
{show.Name}: Season {show.Season} Episode {show.Episode} is available on {server.FriendlyName}.
{show.Name}: Season {show.Season} Episode {show.Episode} is available on {server.FriendlyName}.
{movie.Name}: Movie is available on {server.FriendlyName}.
```

Stretch goal: Messages for removed also.
```
{show.Name}: Season {show.Season} Episode {show.Episode} has been removed from {server.FriendlyName}.
{show.Name}: Season {show.Season} Episode {show.Episode} is available on {server.FriendlyName}.
{movie.Name}: Movie is available on {server.FriendlyName}.
{movie.Name}: Movie has been removed from {server.FriendlyName}.
```
